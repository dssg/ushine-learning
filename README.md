# Ushine Learning

Ushine Learning is an API built to support [Ushahidi](ushahidi.com), a crowdsourced crisis reporting platform.

Before, as reports arrived to the Ushahidi platform, each report had to be reviewed and labeled by a team of humans in a highly manual process.

Now, it can first be routed to Ushine Learning for computerized detection of language, category, location, potentially sensitive information, and near-duplicate messages.

_This is a [Data Science for Social Good](http://www.dssg.io) project._

## Background

In **crisis situations** like contested elections, natural disasters, and troubling humanitarian situations, there's an _information gap_ between the _providers_ (the voters, disaster survivors, and victims) and the _responders_ (the election monitors, aid organizations, NGOs and journalists).

**Crowdsourced crisis reporting platforms**, like Ushahidi, aim to narrow this information gap. They provide centralized software to _collect, curate, and publish reports_ coming from the ground during crises.

## Problem: Human review of reports doesnâ€™t scale

Currently, each report is processed prior to publication by a human reviewer. Reviewers needs to go through a series of tasks: translating, finding the location, applying category labels, removing personally-identifying information, and more. Not only do they have to extract information, but they also need to verify its accuracy against what's truly happening on the ground.

The human review process is slow and tedious, may require domain expertise, and may be inconsistent across reviewers. It is difficult to scale and problematic for high-volume or fast-paced reporting situations.

## Solution: Automatic and suggested labels using natural-language processing

We use computing to make the review process scale. By using machine learning and natural language processing, we can make initial guesses or automatically extract items which previously had been entirely human-determined (such as categories, location, URL, and sensitive information). With our system, no longer must the reviewers do everything from scratch.

This reduces the number of reviewers needed, and lessens the time and tedium they spend processing. Instead, reviewers can focus their energies on _verifying accuracy_ and _responding_ to the reports-- the parts that really matter.

## The Project

The project has 4 major pieces. The **Machine Learning Module**, **Flask Webapp**, and **Ushahidi Plugin** make up the system's architecture. The **User Experiment** is an important part of our methodology: experimental validation of our results by testing with real users.

At the base is a Python **(1) Machine Learning Module** which learns from a corpus of labeled reports and provides automated suggested labels for novel reports. This component needs to have a way to communicate with Ushahidi, a web platform, so we've created a **(2) Flask Webapp** which which wraps the Machine Learning module and can communicate with an Ushahidi server. The Flask Webapp, at a high-level, _receives reports_ from and _sends suggestions_ to Ushahidi, using a REST-ful API and JSON objects. But the truth is that we don't talk directly to a vanilla Ushahidi; instead, we talk to an **(3) Ushahidi Plugin** deployed on a Crowdmap instance. This plugin is written in PHP and connected with the Ushahidi Crowdmap. It provides to glue to send and receive on the Ushahidi side. (Note: this plugin requires some core changes into the Ushahidi platform in order to show its results. We hope these changes will be incorporated into Ushahidi 2.x and 3.0.)

The **(4) User Experiment** was made to test our impact on real users. Without real users, we could evaluate the accuracy of our algorithms on test data. However, the scenarios and outcomes that concerned us most were proving that we improved from "before" (no suggestions) to "after" (with machine suggestions) on parameters like: speed, accuracy, and frustration. You can read in detail about this work and our experimental results in the Wiki.

## Installation Guide

### Basics

Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/dssg/ushine-learning
cd ushine-learning/
```

Install python requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install NTLK dependencies.

```
TODO
```

<!-- TODO: Can we bundle this up more simply? e.g. just install from PIP onto a fresh serer, it will fetch all the requirements? then have a `cmd` which will run it? That'd be rockin. -->

<!--
### Python Package installation

`pip install ushine-learning`
-->

### Webapp Deployment

*Setup configuration*

Create a config file.

```
cp dssg/config/dssg.ini.template dssg/config/dssg.ini
```

Edit the `dssg/config/dssg.ini` config file with
- database settings
- path to classifier, which is stored as a pickled Python object (`/path/to/classifer.pkl`), e.g. in the `dssg/data/classifier` directory.

*How To Run The Flask Web App*

Then, run the webapp. You can run it directly via

```
python server.py
```

To deploy the webapp in production, we suggest using [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) & [nginx](http://nginx.org/).

## Documentation

The latest documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://ushine-learning.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

To update the documentation, you may do the following:

1. Auto-generate the latest API docs. Run `sphinx-apidoc -o doc/source dssg`, passing `-f` flag to overwrite existing apidocs.
2. Optional: Update the doc/source files directly.
3. Make the updated HTML files. Run `make html` from `doc/` path, where makefile resides.
